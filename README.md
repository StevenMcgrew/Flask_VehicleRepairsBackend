# Flask API for a Vehile Repairs Blog
Built with:
* Python
* Flask-SQLAlchemy
* Flask-Migrate

This API is built for an application where people can document their vehicle repairs and share their step-by-step procedures with the ability to add images for each step. They can also search for repairs that have been posted by other users. (*Work in progress. Not all routes finished.)
